describes: FormField
---

This is a helper component that is used by most of the custom form
components. In most cases it shouldn't be used directly.

```js
---
example: true
---
<FormField id="foo" label="Opacity" width="200px">
  <input style={{display: 'block', width: '100%'}}/>
</FormField>
```
